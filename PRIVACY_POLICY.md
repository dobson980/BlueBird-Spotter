# Privacy Policy for BlueBird Spotter

Effective date: February 7, 2026

BlueBird Spotter ("the app") is an independent enthusiast project. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by AST SpaceMobile.

This Privacy Policy explains what data the app handles and how it is used.

## Data We Collect

We do not collect personal data such as your name, email, account credentials, contacts, photos, location, or payment information.

The app does not require user accounts and does not include advertising SDKs or third-party analytics SDKs.

## Data the App Stores On Your Device

To function, the app stores limited technical data locally in the app sandbox:

- Cached public satellite data (TLE payloads) from CelesTrak.
- Cache metadata such as fetch timestamp, source URL, and HTTP cache headers.
- A local timestamp used to manage manual refresh cooldown behavior.

This local data is not used to identify you and is not shared by us as user profiling data.

## Network Requests

The app fetches public satellite element data from CelesTrak over HTTPS.

When the app makes those requests, CelesTrak (like any web service) may receive technical request data such as your IP address and standard HTTP headers. That processing is controlled by CelesTrak, not by this app.

## Background Refresh

If background refresh is available on your device, the app may periodically refresh public TLE data in the background so data is more current when you open the app.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal information.

We do not share personal information with data brokers or advertisers.

The app only communicates with external services needed to provide core functionality (currently CelesTrak for public TLE data).

## Data Retention

Locally cached app data remains on your device until it is replaced, cleared by app removal, or removed by system storage management.

## Children's Privacy

The app is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

The app uses HTTPS for network requests where supported by the data source. No method of transmission or storage is guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## Your Choices

You can:

- Remove locally stored app data by deleting the app.
- Control background refresh via iOS Settings.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected by revising the effective date above.

## Contact

If you have privacy questions, contact the developer through the repository associated with this app.
